    <h1>Week 05</h1>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>System error ― theres a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting. </li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
            <li>ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly.</li>
            <li>use the alert function to debug becuase alert will stop the code until OK is clicked.</li>
            <li>the console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the console. 
            This will show the functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring while the code is running.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>i know in python they have errors and exceptions that can help the code fail loudly, do they have something like that in javascript?</li>
            <li>What have you found the most useful as you have worked with javascript and probably debugged lots of little errors?</li>
            <li>Oh, I think throwing exceptions is similiar to errors and exceptions in python.</li>
        </ol>
