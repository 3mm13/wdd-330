        <h1>Week 02</h1>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I think that it is interesting that some people teach that comments are crucial and one fo the best practices
                to following when trying to acheive clean and readable code. I have read parts of the book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin,
                and he believes that your code should be readalbe without comments. He teaches that your variable names,
                function names, and classes should be strategically named where the code is understandable without comments. </li>
            <li> operator ---> +</li>
            <li> operands ---> #</li>
            <li> You can assign multiple variables with one "let" keyword. Example: let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;</li>
            <li> 'const' and 'let' have a block scope</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What is "NaN" and why is it an important part of of the javascript language?</li>
            <li>Is there a benefit to using type coercion? If you can change a string into a number using the 
                Nummber() function would there ever be a time where you would use type coercion over the number function?</li>
            <li>Novice to Ninja mentions that all functions have names. I am assuming that is not including the anonymous funcitons?</li>
        </ol>
