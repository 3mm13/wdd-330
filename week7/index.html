    <h1>Week 07</h1>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>IIFE - An anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as its defined </li>
            <li>Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.</li>
            <li>Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didnt work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.</li>
            <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. </li>
            <li>The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet. Once it has read the whole file, it returns a promise that resolves with a blob object.</li>
            
        </ol>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>When would be a good use case to use Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves?</li>
            <li>Any advice on the best way to practice recursive functions? I feel like this is a concept that I understand but as soon 
                as I try to implement it I realize I don't fully understand the concept.
