            <li>I did not have a lot of notes on these sections. It was a good review though,
                and I enjoyed the "doing stuff with web things" textbook. I thought it was easy
                to read. </li>

            <li>
                I'm curious as to know how much security frontend developers consider
                while creating. I understand local storage stays locally on the computer, 
                but when it isn't stored locally, does the frontend developer need to consider
                how the data is encrypted? Or would that technically be the backend developers job?
            </li>
