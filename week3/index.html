        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Document Object Model ==> DOM </li>
            <li> const body = document.body;</li>
            <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Is there a cheatsheet that helps you remember all of the document.methods?? I feel like
                I am going to be googling syntax for a while until I get them all in my head
            </li>
            <li>In practice, are a lot of companies using pure vanilla javascript? I have heard a lot about frameworks 
                and how those are very common with javascript. What are the pros and cons of using a framework and pure 
                javascript?
